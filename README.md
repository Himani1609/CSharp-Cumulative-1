This C# project is designed as a cumulative assignment, demonstrating the implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) concepts. It includes classes, properties, and methods that manage data, particularly in an educational context, where Teacher objects represent instructors with attributes like TeacherId, TeacherFName, TeacherLName, TeacherHireDate, EmployeeNumber, and TeacherSalary.

**Features**
*Teacher Class*: Includes properties such as TeacherId, TeacherFName, TeacherLName, TeacherHireDate, EmployeeNumber, and TeacherSalary.
*Data Management*: Designed to handle various aspects of a teacher's information for easy retrieval and management.
*OOP Principles*: Utilizes encapsulation, getters, and setters to ensure data integrity and code readability.


**Usability**
This project is intended for educational institutions, developers, or anyone interested in managing teacher data using object-oriented programming concepts. By utilizing this project, users can:
*Demonstrate CRUD functionality*: Create and manage data related to teachers, including unique identification numbers, names, hire dates, employee numbers, and salary details.
*Demonstrate OOP Principles*: This project is ideal for developers learning C# as it provides practical examples of encapsulation, property management, and class structures.

**The project can serve as a learning tool for**:
*New Developers*: By exploring a simple C# project structure.
*Students*: Studying OOP concepts and looking for practical examples.
*Institutions*: For potential adaptation into more extensive data management applications.
