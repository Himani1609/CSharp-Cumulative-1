# School Database MVP - CRUD Operations for Teachers, Students, and Courses

## Project Overview
This project is a cumulative assignment showcasing the implementation of **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations using _ASP.NET Core Web API and MVC_. The application manages data for teachers, students, and courses within a school database. The core objective is to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that supports efficient data management through both API endpoints and dynamic web pages.

## Features

- **_Comprehensive CRUD Operations_**: Enables users to create, read, update, and delete records for teachers, students, and courses through APIs and dynamic web pages.
- **_Data Validation and Integrity_**: Implements error handling for invalid entries, such as future dates, duplicate identifiers, and missing required fields.
- **_Relational Database Integration_**: Utilizes MySQL with properly structured relationships, ensuring data consistency between teachers, students, and courses.

## Testing and Validation
The project includes comprehensive testing to ensure each CRUD operation works correctly, with cURL commands and web page interaction screenshots as evidence. The testing covers:

- **_Adding Records_**: Validation of data input and correct database insertion.
- **_Reading Records_**: Verification of accurate retrieval and display of teacher, student, and course data from the database.
- **_Updating Records_**: Verification of accurate update of teacher, student, and course data in the database.
- **_Deleting Records_**: Proper deletion confirmation and handling non-existent records.

## Usability
This project is designed for educational institutions or developers interested in managing academic data using ASP.NET Core. It provides a learning tool for developers and students to understand core concepts in web development, database interaction, and object-oriented programming.

## Learning Objectives

- **_CRUD Operations Mastery_**: Implement full CRUD functionality across three different data models: Teachers, Students, and Courses.
- **_OOP Principles in Practice_**: Use encapsulation, property management, and modular class structures for clarity and scalability.
- **_Database Integration_**: Utilize relational database principles with foreign key relationships between Courses and Teachers.
