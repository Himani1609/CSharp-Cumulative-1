# Project Overview

This C# project is designed as a cumulative assignment, demonstrating the implementation of **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete)** operations. It includes classes, properties, and methods to manage data, specifically for an educational context where `Teacher` objects represent instructors with attributes like `TeacherId`, `TeacherFName`, `TeacherLName`, `TeacherHireDate`, `EmployeeNumber`, and `TeacherSalary`.

## Features

- **Teacher Class**: Includes properties such as `TeacherId`, `TeacherFName`, `TeacherLName`, `TeacherHireDate`, `EmployeeNumber`, and `TeacherSalary`.
- **Data Management**: Designed to handle various aspects of a teacher's information for easy retrieval and management.
- **OOP Principles**: Utilizes encapsulation, getters, and setters to ensure data integrity and code readability.

## Usability

This project is intended for educational institutions, developers, or anyone interested in managing teacher data using object-oriented programming concepts. By utilizing this project, users can:

- **Demonstrate CRUD Functionality**: Create and manage data related to teachers, including unique identification numbers, names, hire dates, employee numbers, and salary details.
- **Explore OOP Principles**: This project is ideal for developers learning C#, as it provides practical examples of encapsulation, property management, and class structures.

The project serves as a learning tool for:
- **_New Developers_**: By exploring a simple C# project structure.
- **_Students_**: Studying OOP and CRUD concepts and looking for practical examples.
